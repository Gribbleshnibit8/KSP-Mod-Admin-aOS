//// BUGS
/////////////////////
- ModName changes after Mod update.
- AVC Plugin - Problem when a mod archive contains multiple version files. (Sample: Mission Controller 2 on KerbalStuff)
- Some mods have additional folders that normally doesn't install. 
  It can be folders with alternative data, manuals, etc. For examples see Planet Shine or UniversalStorage [TAC PACK]. 
  Usually Mod Admin can't detect installation path for them and shows warning. When I update this mods, Mod Admin shows warning again for every root node 
  without installation path. I update in "Copy checked state" mode.

//// To Test

//// TODO
/////////////////////

- AVC Plugin version file support
  - Bug fix see BUGS above.
  
- ReadMe

- is everything Async ???

- KSPForum support.

- Control rearrangement for localization

- Don't load all languages into memory! 

- Tab to enable/disable plugins
  - Don't enable unknown plugins during loading.
  - Save known plugins (+ enable state) to AppConfig.
  - Remove known but not found plugins (or ask the user).

- ModSelection
  -> key action binding -> del = remove mod ...

- Restart destination detection.

- Conflict detection/solving

- Revise of the English/German text
  - unify URL, link, site, page
  - spelling error
  - wording

- Try loading old KSPModAdmin.cfg file if no new cfg file is available.
  -> For AppConfig and KSPConfig!
  
- Search in ModSelection.
- Overwrite button states are indistinguishable. It's hard to say, what mode it is in. May be checkbox would be more visual?
  - Change ToolTip to display On/Off state?

- Center CheckBoxes us TreeViewAdv.

- Implementation of a waffle iron !!! =)
